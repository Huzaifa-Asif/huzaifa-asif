## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### About

As a Solution Architect and Engineering Lead with over nine years of experience, I specialize in designing and implementing solutions that align with business goals and industry standards. Currently, I lead the development of cutting-edge products at Evert, a company dedicated to revolutionizing the future power grid with smart technology. Our top-quality products are designed for seamless integration and effortless energy management, simplifying the complexities of modern energy systems.

In my role at Evert, I focus on architecting scalable and secure solutions that drive innovation and efficiency. I collaborate closely with stakeholders to translate business requirements into technical strategies, leveraging AWS cloud services and best practices to optimize performance. I also mentor and lead a skilled development team, ensuring that our products meet the highest standards of quality and security.

Beyond my work at Evert, I serve as an Advocate at Grafana Labs, where I create educational content, including videos and blogs, to promote Grafana and K6 within the tech community. I engage with open-source communities, offering expert guidance on data visualization and performance testing.

My expertise spans fintech, BaaS, SaaS, and PaaS products for clients such as KFH Kuwait, KFH Bahrain, and Simah Saudi Arabia. I have a strong foundation in system analysis, design, and full-stack development. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and have earned certifications in AWS Foundations, Redis Data Structures, and more.

In addition to my professional work, I actively share my knowledge through my YouTube channel, blog posts, and my book, "Designing Scalable Systems". I am passionate about delivering business value through innovative software solutions and empowering others in the tech community.
